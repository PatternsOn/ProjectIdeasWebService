# Projectideas

A micro school project. The idea is to make a database for storing ideas for simple 
school projects.

Requirements
- Login with security (A + if you use JDBCRealm instead of FileRealm)
- At least one JSF page (Prime etc)
- JPA Entities with at least on simple relation (one-to-many)
- Some kind of edit/save function that will be stored in JPA Entity + database.
