# Projectideas

A micro school project. The idea is to make a database for storing ideas for simple 
school projects.

(new) Requirements
- Create an api with JAX-RS and connect to your database 
- Create a client (separate project) which consumes the api
- Evolve with more functions


(old) Requirements
- Login with security (A + if you use JDBCRealm instead of FileRealm)
- At least one JSF page (Prime etc)
- JPA Entities with at least one simple relation (one-to-many)
- Some kind of edit/save function that will be stored in JPA Entity + database
